  Mimblewimble is a blockchain protocol that focuses on privacy through the implementation of 
  confidential transactions.
  It enables a greatly simplified blockchain in which all spent transactions can be pruned, resulting in a much smaller
  blockchain footprint and efficient base node validation. The blockchain consists only of block-headers, remaining 
  Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO) with their range proofs and an unprunable transaction kernel per transaction.
